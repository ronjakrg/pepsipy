PEPSI is an open-source Python package that provides methods for computing a wide range of peptide features, including sequence composition, charge, hydrophobicity, and other physicochemical properties. All features can be calculated on an entire dataset or on a single peptide sequence of interest. Additionally, PEPSI offers a selection of visualisations, such as hydropathy profile or amino acid classification.
This work was conducted as part of the project 'Veni, Vidi, Visualization: Improving Analysis Communication for a Million-Dollar Machine' at the Data Analytics and Computational Statistics Chair, Hasso Plattner Institute.
